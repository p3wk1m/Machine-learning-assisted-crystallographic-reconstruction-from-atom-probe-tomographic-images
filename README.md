# Machine-learning-assisted-crystallographic-reconstruction-from-atom-probe-tomographic-images

This is the code repository for the paper "Machine learning assisted crystallographic reconstruction from atom probe tomographic images".<br>

The repository includes three folder:<br>
(1) dataset, which is the 3D image dataset used for machine learning in the paper,<br>
(2) modified_TAPSim, which is the key modified code based on the original TAPSim C++ code, <br>
(3) ML_model, which is the three ML models in the backward process of the paper.<br>
